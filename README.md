# What I hope to learn
### What I hope to Get Out of the Course
I hope to better understand how to effectively employ data visualization techniques to let data tell the story. I have a pretty technical background, but none of my core classes are focused on the visualization side of data.

### Plans After Graduation
After graduation, I'll be working as a manager for a data science team at an Artificial Intelligence company in Pittsburgh. As a manger, I know it's important to be able to adequately visualize data for higher leadership when they need a quick plot.
