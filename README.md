This is my public profile for projects completed during CMU's 94870 Telling Stories With Data.

# About me
### Name
Hannah Fairfield
### Pronouns
She/Her/Hers
### Program
[Masters in Information Systems Management, Business Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/bida)


# What I hope to learn
talk about what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.  You can include other information you think is helpful to the rest of the class, including a photo if you like - follow the Github markdown guide to learn how.
### What I hope to Get Out of the Course
I hope to better understand how to effectively employ data visualization techniques to let data tell the story. I have a pretty technical background, but none of my core classes are focused on the visual size of data.

### Plans After Graduation
After graduation, I'll be working as a manager for a data science team at an Artifical Intelligence company in Pittsburgh. As a manger, I know it's important to be able to adequately visualize data for higher leadership when they need a quick plot.
