*This graph is pulled directly from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's website. It is looking at the General Government Debt for multiple countries around the world. It's a bar chart sorted from lowest to highest debt-to-GDP ratio for 2019.*

*I created these line charts using Flourish.studio. These charts use the same data as the first data visualization above whcih was pulled from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). The x-axis looks at year and is sorted from  earliest (1995) to latest (2019). The Y axis looks at debt as a percentage of GDP (debt-to-GDP ratio). I considered transforming this to log, but decided against it because I did not want to minimize the effect of the large ratios that many countries have. I used dark blue for the plot color because it's a sad color, and will be more striking with the countries that have higher debt-to-GDP ratios. *
