## Visualization 1

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6S4n" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6S4n" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>

*This graph is pulled directly from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). It is looking at the General Government Debt for multiple countries around the world. It's a bar chart sorted from lowest to highest debt-to-GDP ratio for 2019.*

## Visualization 2

*I created these line charts using Flourish.studio. This chart uses the same data as the first data visualization above which was pulled from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). The x-axis looks at year and is sorted from  earliest (1995) to latest (2019). The Y axis looks at debt as a percentage of GDP (debt-to-GDP ratio). I considered transforming this to log, but decided against it because I did not want to minimize the effect of the large ratios that many countries have. I used dark blue for the plot color because it's a sad color, and will be more striking with the countries that have higher debt-to-GDP ratios.*

*I created this area chart using Flourish.studio. This chart uses the same data as the first and second data visualizations above which were pulled from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). I created this area chart to emphasize the changes over the years, and the drastic differences between some of the countries. With the area chart, it makes it more dramatic and obvious when a country's debt-to-GDP ratio is very high. I kept a dark blue color to indicate that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios.*
