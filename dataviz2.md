## Source Information
The source for this dataset is [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) from their National Accounts at a Glance library. The dataset has information for 41 countries' debt-to-GDP ratio. Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. OECD used currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable to calculate debt. 

## Visualization 1 -- Government Debt Bar Chart

*This bar chart is pulled directly from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). It illustrates the General Government Debt for 41 countries in 2019, sorted lowest to highest debt-to-GDP ratio.*

## Visualization 2 -- The Grid of Line Charts

*I created these line charts using Flourish.studio using the same [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) data set as above. This grid of line charts illustrates debt-to-GDP ratio for 41 countries sorted from  earliest (1995) to latest (2019). I considered transforming this to log, but decided against it because I did not want to minimize the effect of the large ratios that many countries have. I used dark blue for the plot color to indicate that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios. Additionally, it will be more striking with the countries that have higher debt-to-GDP ratios.*

## Visualization 3 -- Free Style -- A Grid of Area Charts

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11702884"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

*I created this area chart using Flourish.studio. This chart uses the same data as the first and second data visualizations above which were pulled from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). These charts illustrate a country's debt-to-GDP ratio from 1992 to 2019. The area chart's use of color is effective at displaying the severity of a high debt-to-GDP ratio. The dark blue color  indicates that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios.* 

## Analysis on Different Methods of Visualization

In this assignment, we looked at three different types of charts: bar charts, line charts, and area charts.

**_Bar Charts_** are great visualization tools for discrete data. The bars can be grouped, or stacked to compare different variables. They're best used when there is not an execessive number of categories.

**PROS**
1. Bar charts are effective for comparisons and rankings between categories.
2. Bar charts are popular, and readers likely have experience with them already. Although it's necessary to explain the varialbes in the bar chart, what they mean, and why they are important, it's a bonus to **not** have to explain how the chart works to readers. 

**CONS**
1. Bar charts can only be used with discrete data.
2. Although most readers are likely comfortable with bar charts, they require additional written explanation, otherwise they can be misinterpreted. 

**_Line Charts_** are useful for continuous data, and are best when there is a lot of data. Line charts can have multiple variables plotted, or can be split into multiple line charts in a grid format for easy comparison, like what we did with visualization 2.

**PROS**
1. Line charts can be use to visualize continuous data, which without a visualization can be difficult to understand and interpret.
2. Line charts clearly show general trends of data.

**CONS**
1. It's easy to misinterpret the data in a line chart if the axis sclaes are inconsistent.
2. When multiple plots are being compared at once on one graph, it can become overwhelming and difficult to interpret. 

**_Area Charts_** combine the bar chart with the line chart. They are useful for continuous data. They're typically used to make comparisons between variables as a stacked area chart, but if there are too many variables it can be distracting and unclear. They can also be used to look at one variable's changes over time, which is how I used the area chart for visualization 3. I chose to use this type of data visualization to emphasize the changes over the years, and the drastic differences between some of the countries. With the area chart, it makes it more dramatic and obvious when a country's debt-to-GDP ratio is very high because there is the obvious high amount of color. I kept a dark blue color to indicate that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios.

**PROS** 
1. Area charts effectively display large differences between data points.
2. Area charts can be used to compare multiple variables. 

**CONS**
1. Area charts use a lot of color, and if use of colors or pixels are limited then it can be difficult to make an effective area chart.
2. It is difficult to pinpoint exact data points.
