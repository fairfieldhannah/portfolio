## Source Information
The source for this dataset is [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) from their National Accounts at a Glance library. The dataset has information for 41 countries' debt-to-GDP ratio. Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. OECD used currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable to calculate debt. 

## Visualization 1 -- Government Debt Bar Chart

*This bar chart is pulled directly from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). It illustrates the General Government Debt for 41 countries in 2019, sorted lowest to highest debt-to-GDP ratio.*

## Visualization 2 -- The Grid of Line Charts

*I created these line charts using Flourish.studio using the same [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) data set as above. This grid of line charts illustrates debt-to-GDP ratio for 41 countries sorted from  earliest (1995) to latest (2019). I considered transforming this to log, but decided against it because I did not want to minimize the effect of the large ratios that many countries have. I used dark blue for the plot color to indicate that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios. Additionally, it will be more striking with the countries that have higher debt-to-GDP ratios.*

## Visualization 3 -- The Grid of Area Charts

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11702884"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

*I created this area chart using Flourish.studio. This chart uses the same data as the first and second data visualizations above which were pulled from [the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). These charts illustrate a country's debt-to-GDP ratio from 1992 to 2019. The area chart's use of color is effective at displaying the severity of a high debt-to-GDP ratio. The dark blue color  indicates that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios.* 

## Analysis on Different Methods of Visualization

In this assignment, we looked at three different types of charts: bar charts, line charts, and area charts.\ 

*Bar Charts* are great visualization tools for discrete data. The bars can be grouped, or stacked to compare different variables. They're best used when there is not an execessive number of categories.\ 

*Line Charts* are useful for continuous data, and are best when there is a lot of data. Line charts can have multiple variables plotted, or can be split into multiple line charts for easy comparison, like what we did with visualization 2.\ 

*Area Charst* combines the bar chart with the line chart. It's useful for continuous data. It's typically used to make comparisons between variables as a stacked area chart, but if there are too many variables it can be distracting and unlear. They can also be used to look at one variable's changes over time, which is how I used the area chart for visualization 3. I chose to use this type of data visualization to emphasize the changes over the years, and the drastic differences between some of the countries. With the area chart, it makes it more dramatic and obvious when a country's debt-to-GDP ratio is very high. I kept a dark blue color to indicate that higher debt-to-GDP ratios are worse than lower debt-to-GDP ratios.
