# Final Project II

### Wireframes and storyboards
Student has created a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for their project. The sketches are high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story the student wishes to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or prototypes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life


### Design: data visualizations
Data visualizations are identified, and sketches include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations are appropriate for the project, and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. Important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately.

### User research: protocol
The goal of the research is to gauge audience understanding of the wireframes and storyboard. 
**a.** the target audience I hope to reach with my story is people who live within the communities with the highest drug-issues so they can understand the situation in their local area. This may garner support for locals to help better drug-related issues.  
**b.** I want to get three people from completely different backgrounds, races, and ages so that I can get as different of people to interview as possible. I want each person to be very different because I want them to provide their honest opinions in how the visualization impacts them. If people have the same background, it's likely that the visualization will impact them in similar ways. 
**c.** My interview script is:
1. What is the visualization portraying?
2. What stands out to you in this visualization?
3. Is there anything you would change about this visualization?
4. Is this information alarming or expected? 
5. If this information portrayed your local area, how would you react?

### User research: findings
The student has documented the findings from the interviews, including specific insights and observations, key quotes and other learnings. The student has identified what changes they plan on implementing based on the feedback to address any issues raised in the user research. Student has completed at least three interviews. The interviewees are broadly described (e.g. student, 20's), but all PII and any sensitive information has been removed.
**a.** I interviewed the following three people:
1.
2.
3.
**b.** The findings of my interview are:
**c.** changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
