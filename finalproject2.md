# Final Project II

### Wireframes and storyboards
Student has created a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for their project. The sketches are high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story the student wishes to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or prototypes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life

With the increase in drug overdose deaths, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Injury Prevention & Control office states that the US is in an ["overdose crisis"](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/featured-topics/overdose-prevention-campaigns.html).

**Setup:** where in the United States is the drug overdose problem the worst?

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System [(NVSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm) counts drug overdose deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The data is submitted by states, who pull overdose death statistics from death certificates, and send reports to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 

We can see that West Virginia has the highest number of drug overdoses per 100,000. To better understand why West Viriginia has the highest number of overdoses from states that reported to NCHS, we can see where in West Virginia the overdoses are occuring.

According to the data, Franklin county had the highest amount of overdoses in 2020. 

**Conflict:** what factors influence areas to have bigger issues with drug overdoses? Is there a certain demographic who experiences a higher number of overdoses?


**Resolution:** what can we do to decrease drug overdoses in the United States?


### Design: data visualizations
Data visualizations are identified, and sketches include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations are appropriate for the project, and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. Important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately.

### User research: protocol
The goal of the research is to gauge audience understanding of the wireframes and storyboard. 
**a.** the target audience I hope to reach with my story is people who live within the communities with the highest drug-issues so they can understand the situation in their local area. This may motivate locals to support their local drug overdose prevention organizations.  
**b.** I want to get three people from completely different backgrounds, races, and ages so that I can get as different of people to interview as possible. I want each person to be very different because I want them to provide their honest opinions in how the visualization impacts them. If people have the same background, it's likely that the visualization will impact them in similar ways. 
**c.** My interview script is:
1. What is the visualization portraying?
2. What stands out to you in this visualization?
3. Is there anything you would change about this visualization?
4. Is this information alarming or expected? 
5. If this information portrayed your local area, how would you react?

### User research: findings
**a.** I interviewed the following three people:
1.
2.
3.
**b.** The findings of my interview are:
including specific insights and observations, key quotes and other learnings.

**c.** changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. (address any issues raised in the user research.)
