# Accidental Drug Overdoses in Allegheny County

## Outline
With the increase in drug overdose deaths, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Injury Prevention & Control office states that the US is in an "overdose crisis." Because this is such a prominent issue in the United States today, I'm looking at Allegheny county's accidental drug overdose statistics. I want to start by exploring where in Allegheny county accidental drug overdoses are occuring. A quick glance at the data shows that there are some municipalities that have more accidental drug overdoses than other municipalities. Next, I want to look at potential reasons for why accidental drug overdoses are more common in those municipalities. I plan to expand off of [Allegheny County's Accidental Overdose Data](https://analytics.alleghenycounty.us/2021/06/01/accidental-overdose-deaths-in-allegheny-county-report-and-dashboard/) by looking at crime datasets, and census datasets. Finally, I want to explore what can be done to help those municipalities. 

## Sketches
Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.

## Data
Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.

I will likely add more datasets as I progress through the final project, but I am starting with three datasets.

My first dataset is the [Allegheny County's Accidental Overdose Data](https://analytics.alleghenycounty.us/2021/06/01/accidental-overdose-deaths-in-allegheny-county-report-and-dashboard/). I will use the data from this dataset to explore where in Allegheny county accidental drug overdoses are most prominent. I'm using this dataset to make visualization 1 and visualization 2. 

My second dataset is from [Open Data PA's Estimated Drug Overdose Deaths CY 2012-Current](https://data.pa.gov/Opioid-Related/Estimated-Drug-Overdose-Deaths-CY-2012-Current-Cou/azzc-q64m?referrer=embed). I will use this dataset to compare Allegheny County's drug overdose deaths to the entire state's statistics. 

My third dataset is from [The City of Pittsburgh's Historical Blotter Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data). I will use this dataset to compare higher crime areas with higher drug overdose areas to see if this could give more insight as to why some areas have higher accidental drug overdoses. 

## Method and Medium
I will be completing the project using free hand sketches, Tableau, Flourish, and Shorthand. I will use free hand sketches to create my wireframes. I will use Tableau and Flourish to create my visualizations. I will use Shorthand to display my completed final project.
