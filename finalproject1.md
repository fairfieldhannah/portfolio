# Accidental Drug Overdoses in Allegheny County

## Outline
With the increase in drug overdose deaths, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Injury Prevention & Control office states that the US is in an "overdose crisis." Because this is such a prominent issue in the United States today, I'm looking at accidental drug overdose statistics. I want to start by exploring where in the United States accidental drug overdoses are most commonly occuring. A quick glance at the data shows that there are some municipalities that have more accidental drug overdoses than other municipalities. Next, I want to look at potential reasons for why accidental drug overdoses are more common in those municipalities. I plan to expand off of the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention's State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDOR)](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/dashboard/index.html) by focusing on one of the most prominent states with accidental drug overdoses. I'd like to then look at crime datasets, and census datasets. Finally, I want to explore what can be done to help those areas. 

## Sketches
Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.

This tree map displays the 29 states that submit reports to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDOR). SUDOR's purpose is to "presents comprehensive information on the characteristics and circumstances surrounding drug overdose deaths to inform prevention and response efforts". The data is submitted by states, who pull overdose death statistics from from death certificates, medical examiner/coroner reports, and postmortem toxicology results.

This simple table explores the breakdown of deaths by gender. We can see that men more than double the women's statistics. 



## Data
Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.

I will likely add more datasets as I progress through the final project, but I am starting with three datasets.

My first dataset is the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention's State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDOR)](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/dashboard/index.html). I will use the data from this dataset to explore where in the United States accidental drug overdoses are most prominent. A limitation with this dataset is that only 29 states have reported their accidental overdose data to the CDC's SUDOR system. Because of this, we can only compare states that have submitted their data to SUDOR. 

My second dataset is from [Open Data PA's Estimated Drug Overdose Deaths CY 2012-Current](https://data.pa.gov/Opioid-Related/Estimated-Drug-Overdose-Deaths-CY-2012-Current-Cou/azzc-q64m?referrer=embed). I will use this dataset to compare Allegheny County's drug overdose deaths to the entire state's statistics. 

My third dataset is from [The City of Pittsburgh's Historical Blotter Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data). I will use this dataset to compare higher crime areas with higher drug overdose areas to see if this could give more insight as to why some areas have higher accidental drug overdoses. 

## Method and Medium
I will be completing the project using free hand sketches, Tableau, Flourish, and Shorthand. I will use free hand sketches to create my wireframes. I will use Tableau and Flourish to create my visualizations. I will use Shorthand to display my completed final project.
