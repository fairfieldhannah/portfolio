### Accidental Drug Overdoses in Allegheny County

# Outline
Proposal includes a high-level summary of the project; project structure that outlines major elements of the story.

I want to start by exploring where accidental drug overdoses are occuring in Allegheny county. A quick glance at the data shows that there are some municipalities that have more accidental drug overdoses than other municipalities. Next, I want to look at potential reasons for why accidental drug overdoses are more common in those municipalities. I plan to expand off of [Allegheny County's Accidental Overdose Data] () Finally, I want to explore what can be done to help those municipalities. 

# Sketches
Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.

# Data
Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.

# Method and Medium
A few sentences documenting how the project will be completed. Platform for the final project identified.
